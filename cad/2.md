# Encoding Format

## Overview

Convex implements a standard data encoding format that represents any valid Convex data values.

## Basic Rules

The Encoding MUST be a sequence of bytes.

Any given data value MUST map to one and only one valid encoding. 

Any two distinct (non-identical) data values MUST map to a different Encoding

The Encoding MUST have a maximum length of 8191 bytes. This ensure that an Encoded value will always fit within a reasonable fixed size buffer.

## Value ID

The Value ID of a data value is defined to be the unique SHA3-256 hash of the Encoding.

Assuming the cryptographic strength of SHA3-256, Value IDs can be considered to uniquely represent the data value to which they refer.

## Valid and Invalid Encodings

A sequence of bytes is a Valid Encoding is there exists a data value which produces the same sequence of bytes as its Encoding.

A sequence of bytes is an Invalid Encoding if there is no data value which produces the same sequence of bytes as its Encoding.

Implementations MUST be able to reconstruct a data value from any Valid Encoding.

Implementations MUST recognise an Invalid Encoding, and in particular:

- Implementations MUST recognise an Invalid Coding if the byte sequence contains additional bytes after the end of a Valid Encoding
- Implementations MUST recognise an Invalid Encoding if the byte sequence terminates before enough bytes are obtained to complete a Valid Encoding 

## Tag Byte

The first byte of the Encoding is defined to be the Tag, which designates the type of the data value, and determines how the remainder of the Encoding should be interpreted.

Implementations MUST recognise an Invalid Encoding if the Tag byte is not recognised as one defined in this document.
