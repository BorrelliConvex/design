# Convex Name System

The Convex name system (CNS) is a globally accessible naming service available on the CVM.

## Motivation

Similar to DNS on the Internet, there is a need for a naming which system which provides:

- Meaningful human readable names
- A mapping to resources on the network
- Secure facilities for managing this information

## Alternatives

Nothing in Convex requires the use of CNS. It must be possible to create working systems on the CVM without relying on CNS.

Alternative CNS implementations must be possible, with a different CNS root.
