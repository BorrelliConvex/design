# The Convex Manifesto - DRAFT

Convex is a public network for real-time value exchange, designed as a substrate for decentralised economic transactions and smart contracts.

We are building Convex and its ecosystem because we believe that this capability is essential for a fair, inclusive, efficient and sustainable economic system.

This manifesto outlines our beliefs and core principles.

## Decentralised Economics

Everyone should have equal, fair and direct access to the mechanisms of our economic system. Access should be possible for everyone on a first class basis without being required to use privileged gatekeepers or pay middlemen.

## Sustainability

The economic system must be ecologically responsible, supporting economic transactions without unnecessary waste or environmental costs. Among other things, this rules out Proof of Work as acceptable tools for consensus.

## Open Source

Technology should be open source, developed by the community in the interests of all users. This applies particularly to the libraries and tools required by users to interact with Convex.

Convex itself is open source software, released under the Convex Public License (CPL). The CPL is a relatively permissive open source license that in addition supports effective network governance.

## The Convex Coin

The Convex network requires a native currency. We need a protocol defined coin for two main reasons: firstly, as a way to pay a fair price to compensate those who provide infrastructure and services to the network on an ongoing basis (peer operators, developers etc.) and secondly as a means to regulate usage of the network (if transactions were free in a public permissionless network, nothing would prevent a malicious actor from flooding the network with malicious transactions and preventing genuine users from using it).

We have therefore implemented the Convex Coin, a protocol defined currency that can be used to purchase services on the Convex network. In that sense, it can be regarded as a "utility token". It also serves the traditional roles of a currency in that it is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.

The Convex Coin has a fixed maximum supply of `1,000,000,000,000,000,000` units. For convenience, we designate the quantity `1,000,000,000` as `1 Convex Gold`, i.e. the maximum supply is one billion Convex Gold, each of which can be subdivided one billion times.

We require a fair way of distributing the initially issued Convex Coins. Therefore, coins will be issued gradually over time to people or organisations that contribute to developing Convex and the broader ecosystem. Contributions may be technology (e.g. writing code, developer advocacy), business (e.g. delivering a commercial use case on Convex) or financial (i.e. being an initial purchaser of coins, where the funds raised will be used to grow Convex further).

Once Convex Coins are initially issued, they are the property of the holder and secured by the holder's cryptographic keys. The holder may then utilise them as they choose, which may include paying for network services or transferring them to others as part of a value exchange.

The use of the Convex coin as part of the protocol does not in any way prevent other currencies from being established by users of the Convex network. Indeed, a key capability of Convex is the ability it gives for all users to create their own currencies, tokens and other digital assets.


## Network Governance

Convex should be governed in the interests of all users as a public service network. This governance must be sustainable, in the sense that adequate provision should be made to allow for continued investment in the core technology and infrastructure, supporting the common needs of ecosystem participants. 

As a public utility that records important economic information on a decentralised basis, the network must avoid forks since these present significant risk of confusion and loss to participants in the ecosystem. Forks are obviously not desirable in a system designed to act as a source of truth for asset ownership, contract state and account balances etc. 

At present, the governance role is filled by the Convex Foundation, a non-profit company registered in the United Kingdom. 

The Convex Foundation will manage a long term fund, comprising both an initial endowment of Convex Coins and proceeds from the sale of Convex Coins to initial purchasers. 

In the longer term, options for decentralised governance will be explored. Decentralised governance will be adopted if and only if we have sufficient confidence that it is practical to implement and serves the interest of Convex users and society as a whole.
