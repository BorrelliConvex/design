The Convex Manifesto - an early draft



Everyone should have equal, fair and direct access to the mechanisms of our economic system. Access should be possible for everyone on a first class basis without being required to use privileged gatekeepers or pay middlemen.

The economic system must be ecologically responsible, supporting economic transactions without unnecessary waste or environmental costs. Among other things, this rules out Proof of Work as acceptable tools for consensus.

Technology should be open source, developed by the community.
