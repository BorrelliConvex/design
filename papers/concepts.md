# Convex Concepts

## Overview

Convex is a decentralised platform for the Internet of Value, offering flexibility and scalability far beyond the capabilities of traditional blockchains. In particular, it is designed to support high volume, interactive applications used directly by end users such as for mobile apps, payments and gaming.





## Governance

Convex is governed by the non-profit Convex Foundation. The Foundation performs the following activities:

- It ensures good governance of the Convex Network
- It operates key resources on behalf of the community, including the https://convex.world website and developer resources such as GitHub repositories
- It acts as a seller of Convex Coins to individuals and organisations, in exchange for money which is used as a fund to re-invest in the Convex ecosystem
- It provides grants and awards for contributors to Convex (e.g. open source developers)
- It supports the development of the Convex ecosystem
